# Simple_Linear_Regression.
It's a simple self made code.
Code to implement simple linear regression by taking x (Independent variable) and y (output or dependent) variable by finding Coefficients b_0 and b_1 to predict unknown y for any value of x.
The trick is very simple.We take x and y matrix from user and with the help of statistics using numpy we find cross deviation and deviation around x.
Then we calculate coefficients b_0 and b_1.
